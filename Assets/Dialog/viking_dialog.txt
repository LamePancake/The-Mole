Viking: Hohohoho. What is a mole doing this far from the den?
Borin: ...
Viking: Oh, what is this?
Viking: A Graylien mind-control hat, perhaps?
Viking: Young mole, may I see your hat?
Borin: ...
Viking: Hohohoho. Not talking eh? I'll just take a little peek.
Viking: *Takes hat off of Borin*
Borin: Where am I? And who are you?
Viking: Isn't it obvious? Hohohoho.
Viking: I am the great Viking Scientist, Adalbert!
Borin: Never heard of you.
Viking: How could you not have heard of me?
Viking: I have prevented all Hell from breaking loose many times.
Borin: Sorry, I don't follow any Viking Scientists.
Viking: Never mind that, this hat is definitely of Graylien-make.
Viking: I must study it some more.
Borin: Where did you get that hat?
Viking: Why it was on your head. Do you not remember?
Borin: No I don't.
Viking: This Graylien tech must have wiped your memories.
Viking: All the more reason to study it.
Viking: May I borrow this hat for a while?
Borin: Sure, I don't need it anymore.
Viking: Excellent. Hohohoho. Oh, I almost forgot.
Viking: King Cornelius is looking for a mole to help stop the Grayliens.
Borin: Does he want to save the moles too?
Viking: Yes, of course!
Viking: He asked me to point worthy moles to the Viking Stronghold.
Viking: You seem like a nice mole. Will you go?
Borin: If it will help me save my brothers. Yes, I'll go.
Viking: Wonderful, now please take this.
Viking: You'll need it to get into the Stronghold.
Viking: It will protect you from the traps.
Viking: *Hands Borin a Viking Hat*
Borin: Traps! What traps?
Viking: Don't worry, you'll be fine. Just remember to use the hat.
Viking: Now, I must be off.
Viking: I need to get back to my lab to study this hat.
Viking: Hohohoho. Good bye young mole. And good luck!
Borin: ...What a strange man. 
Borin: Wait! How do I use this thing?
