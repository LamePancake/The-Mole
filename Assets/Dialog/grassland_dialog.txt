Viking: Ah, it would seem that Adalbert has found 
Viking: someone stupid enough to join our cause.
Viking: Ahem. I mean welcome young mole.
Viking: I am Cornelius, the corny king of the Vikings.
Viking: What is your name?
Borin: What was that first thing you said?
Viking: Oh, it was nothing. Your name?
Borin: My name is Borin, and I would like to help save my brothers.
Viking: Well Borin, do I have a job for you.
Viking: We have tracked the aliens to a movie theatre across the field.
Borin: What's a movie theatre?
Viking: From what we can tell, it is a place where scientists do research.
Borin: Weird.
Viking: Anyways, we believe this is the alien's base.
Viking: Since you can pose as being mind controlled,
Viking: we want you infiltrate the base.
Viking: We need to know what the aliens are planning.
Viking: And if you can stop the Underwatch, your brothers will be free.
Borin: So let me get this straight, you want me to be a mole?
Viking: ...Yes.
Borin: I can dig it.
Viking: Excellent.
Borin: Will you be accompanying me?
Viking: No, of course not, I cannot pose as a mole.
Borin: Fine.
Viking: Since it is dangerous to go alone! Take this.
Viking: *Hands Borin a chicken*
Viking: 'tis my favourite chicken. Please take care of him.
Borin: What am I supposed to do with this?
Viking: When the time comes, he will prove his worth.
Viking: Now go, I must tend to my corn.
