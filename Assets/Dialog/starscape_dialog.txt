Viking: Hohohoho. Young mole, we meet again.
Borin: Hey, do I know you?
Borin: Right, you're Adalbert, the great Viking Scientist.
Borin: What are you doing here?
Viking: Yes. It is I, Adalbert. I have been waiting for you to come.
Borin: Why?
Viking: Isn't it obvious!
Viking: I've made modifications to the mind-control hat you gave me.
Viking: I wanted you to test it out.
Borin: It won't make me lose my memories again will it?
Viking: Of course not!
Viking: It will allow you to control other moles though.
Viking: As long as they are wearing the alien mind-control hat.
Viking: This hat overrides the alien control and lets you control them.
Viking: Is it clear what I'm talking about?
Borin: Very clear. Adalbert. Very clear.
Viking: Now take this and prevent all Hell from breaking loose!
Viking: *Hands Borin the modified mind-control hat*
Borin: Thanks Adalbert.
Borin: What are you going to do now?
Viking: Oh, I'm going to wait here.
Viking: Hohohoho. It's very dangerous for me to go in there.
Borin: Oh, ok.
Borin: It's not like I could use your help or anything.
Borin: .....Why do I have to do everything myself?
Viking: Oh yeah, watch out for a pair of stupid scientists.
Viking: They opened a portal in there a while back.
Viking: They haven't come back yet.
Viking: I wonder what happened to them.
